                <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
                <p>To address these challenges, we implemented a multi-domain, multi-mailbox cold email campaign strategy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Targeted Outreach:</strong> We curated a list of Shopify app owners who align with the podcast’s theme and audience interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Multi-Domain Approach:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leveraged 1 domain and 5 mailboxes to manage the email load and maintain deliverability.</li>
                            <li>Ensured each mailbox sent only 20 emails/day, avoiding spam filters.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Compelling Email Content:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed personalized emails emphasizing the mutual benefits of joining the podcast.</li>
                            <li>A/B tested subject lines and CTAs to maximize engagement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consistent Follow-ups:</strong> Sent polite follow-ups to unresponsive contacts, keeping the outreach non-intrusive.
                    </li>
                </ul>
